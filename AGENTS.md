# AGENTS.md

Operating guide for coding agents working in this repository. The
human-facing equivalents are [README.md](README.md) (what the product does),
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) (contributor setup, CI, releases)
and [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) (vision, principles, roadmap). Design specs
live in [docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/).

Vault Buddy is a Windows desktop companion for Obsidian: a Tauri v2 shell
(Rust) hosting a Vue 3 + Pinia + Tailwind 4 frontend. A tiny always-on-top
transparent window shows an animated buddy; clicking it expands a panel that
lists Obsidian vaults and opens them via `obsidian://` URIs. The app never
writes into vaults.

## What compiles where (read this first)

The Rust code is deliberately split so agents can work outside Windows:

| Path | What it is | Compiles on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src-tauri/core/` | Pure crate: obsidian.json parsing, daily-note resolution, URI building, process detection. No GUI deps. | Anywhere — test and lint locally |
| `src-tauri/` (root crate) | Tauri shell: window, tray, IPC commands, plugins. | **Windows only** (Linux lacks webkit2gtk); CI's Windows job is the compile gate |
| `src/` + `tests/` | Vue frontend + Vitest suite (happy-dom, no Tauri runtime needed) | Anywhere |

When you change the shell crate (`src-tauri/src/*.rs`), you cannot compile it
in a Linux container. Mirror existing patterns exactly, run
`cargo fmt --check`, and let CI's `windows-app` job verify the build.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                              # install (Node 22)
npm test                            # full Vitest suite
npx vitest run tests/<file>.test.ts # single test file
npm run build                       # vue-tsc typecheck + production build
npm run dev                         # Vite dev server only
npm run test-build                  # `tauri dev` — full app, Windows only
npx tauri build                     # real installer build (Windows only)

cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check   # rustfmt gate (whole workspace)
cd src-tauri/core && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd src-tauri/core && cargo test
```

Gotcha: in anything automated, invoke the tauri CLI as `npx tauri <cmd>`,
never through npm script indirection — a past `tauri` script aliased
`tauri dev`, and `npm run tauri build` expanded to `tauri dev build`, which
launched the app on the CI runner and never exited.

## Architecture

### IPC surface (Rust commands, registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)

`list_vaults`, `open_vault`, `open_daily_note`, `prepare_update_install`,
`toggle_panel`, `close_panel`, `close_bubble`, `start_buddy_drag`,
`show_buddy_menu`, `open_logs_folder`, `rearm_crash_detection`, plus the
capture surface: `capture_status`, `start_capture`, `stop_capture`,
`pause_capture`, `resume_capture`, `get_capture_config`,
`set_capture_config`, `list_audio_devices`, `rename_capture` — commands
live in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` and `src-tauri/src/capture_commands.rs`.
Tray + buddy context menu live in `src-tauri/src/tray.rs`; menu item events
are handled in `lib.rs`.

The app is single-instance (`tauri-plugin-single-instance`, registered
FIRST in the builder — keep it first): a second launch exits immediately
and the surviving instance reveals the buddy instead.

### The window system (most invariant-heavy area)

Three separate always-on-top transparent windows, so the buddy window never
resizes. The old design was one window that grew from 88×88 to hold the
panel; WebView2 repaints its stale last frame at the new bounds for a frame
on resize, flashing the buddy to a corner. Splitting the concerns removed the
resize entirely:

- **`main`** — the buddy, fixed 88×88, the only window the user drags and the
  only one whose position is persisted. It never changes size, so it is
  structurally flicker-proof.
- **`panel`** — the vault/settings panel (360×340), created hidden.
- **`bubble`** — the greeting speech bubble (260×150), created hidden.

`panel` and `bubble` are *positioned while hidden, then shown* — a moved-only
window has no stale-frame flash. Placement is one pure function,
`core::companion_placement::panel_position(buddy, work_area, w, h)`
(unit-tested on Linux): it sits the window beside the buddy and clamps it into
the monitor work area so a bottom-/edge-anchored buddy unfolds toward free
space. `position_panel` / `show_bubble` (in `commands.rs`) feed it the live
buddy/monitor geometry; any missing window or monitor info leaves the window
where it was (best-effort, never an error). Invariants:

- **Window show/hide and the placement getters run on the MAIN thread only.**
  `toggle_panel`, `close_panel`, `close_bubble` are *synchronous* commands
  (custom commands aren't capability-gated — only `core:`/`plugin:` are), so
  they run on the main thread where the window getters, `set_position`,
  `show`/`hide` and `set_focus` are valid. `toggle_panel` positions the hidden
  panel, shows it, focuses it, and hides the bubble; opening never touches the
  buddy window. Every exit path and the updater reuse these commands — there
  is no offset/shift to undo, because the buddy never moves to make room.
- **The panel closes itself when focus really leaves the app.**
  `schedule_focus_out_check` (fired from `WindowEvent::Focused(false)`) cannot
  sample focus inline: clicking from panel to buddy fires the source window's
  blur BEFORE the destination's focus lands, so an inline check would see
  neither focused and wrongly hide. `run_on_main_thread` alone won't defer it
  — that runs the closure INLINE when called from the main thread (where
  window events are dispatched). So it sleeps 120 ms on a named worker thread,
  then marshals the check back to the main thread. The check only ever HIDES,
  never shows, so it can never fight `toggle_panel` into a reopen: a buddy
  click that closed the panel leaves the deferred check a no-op.
- Buddy drags go through the `start_buddy_drag` command, never the raw
  `startDragging()` JS API. Being synchronous it runs on the main thread,
  where it re-checks the **logical (swap-aware) primary button** via
  `GetKeyState(VK_LBUTTON)` right before entering the OS move loop and
  drops requests that went stale in IPC transit (a stale synthetic
  WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN starts a buttonless "sticky" move loop on Windows). The
  re-check is **mouse-only** (a touch/pen contact reports `buttons=1` to the
  webview but need not surface as `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`), so the frontend passes
  the pointer type. The command returns whether the drag actually started, and
  the frontend refuses to start one from a pointermove whose button is already
  up. Dragging the buddy closes the panel (`BuddyRoot` invokes `close_panel`
  on drag-start): the panel is its own window now, so it simply hides instead
  of riding the buddy along.
- **Window-state saves and window getters run on the MAIN thread only.**
  `save_window_state` takes the plugin's cache lock and then reads window
  geometry; the plugin's Moved listener takes the same lock on the main
  thread. An off-main save colliding with a drag's Moved flood deadlocked
  both threads and froze the app with no crash record (the original
  "drag crash"). The 1s loop in `lib.rs` is therefore a pure metronome: it
  posts `window_upkeep_tick` (always-on-top re-assert + position
  checkpoint) to the main thread via `run_on_main_thread` with backpressure
  (at most one closure outstanding), and it warns when the main thread
  stops servicing those closures. `finish_quit` marshals its save the same
  way for the finalize-on-worker quit path; `prepare_update_install` must
  stay a synchronous command for the same reason.
- The upkeep tick never touches a window in motion: it is gated by both the
  time since the last Moved event (2s quiescence) and a direct primary-button
  check (a drag paused with the button held emits no Moved events), and the
  position checkpoint (`core::checkpoint::PositionCheckpointer`, unit-tested
  on Linux) only persists a position after it has settled — never on the
  tick a change is first seen. First save still waits out the window-state
  plugin's restore. Exit-time saves alone proved lossy (the updater kills
  the process via `std::process::exit`).
- The metronome thread heartbeat-refreshes a run marker (`app_diagnostics`
  in the core crate) that detects unclean shutdowns the panic hook
  structurally cannot see (native faults, kills, power loss) — every
  graceful exit path (tray/buddy quit, Alt+F4 close, update install) must
  stamp `diagnostics::mark_clean_shutdown()`. All hide paths funnel through
  `tray::hide_buddy`, which hides all three windows (`panel`, `bubble`,
  `main`) and no-ops mid-recording (the buddy is the recording indicator).

### Updater flow (`src/stores/updates.ts`, `UpdateSettings.vue`)

Check → download (panel stays open so spinner/errors are visible) →
`close_panel` (hide the panel window) → `prepare_update_install` (Rust saves
the buddy position and stamps a clean shutdown) → `install()` → `relaunch()`.
The buddy window never shifts, so there is no home position to restore. On
failure the panel reopens on the settings view via `toggle_panel`, `available`
is kept so the install button stays visible for retry, and
`rearm_crash_detection` turns the run marker back on (the prepare step latched
it off). The `Update` object is stored with `markRaw()` — a Vue reactive
proxy breaks its private-field `rid` and every real install would throw.

### The vault domain (core crate + `vaults` store)

Hard rule, amended by the Knowledge Intake increment: **the vault domain
never writes into a vault** — opening notes and creating daily notes is
delegated to Obsidian via `obsidian://` URIs, and every launched URI is
logged (`uri::launch`) as the audit trail. The **one sanctioned write path**
is the capture domain (below), which stores recordings and their companion
notes under strict safety rules; see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-increment-2-knowledge-intake-meeting-recording-design.md`.
Any other code touching vault contents directly is a design change, not a
patch.

Data flow: `%APPDATA%\obsidian\obsidian.json` → `discovery.rs` →
`list_vaults` (open-flag scrub) → `vaults` Pinia store → `VaultList.vue` →
`open_vault` / `open_daily_note` → `uri.rs` → OS URI handler → Obsidian.

- **`discovery.rs`** parses Obsidian's own registry into
  `Vault { id, name, path, open }`. The `id` is the registry's hex key; the
  display name is the last path component (split on `/` **and** `\` —
  obsidian.json stores backslash paths on Windows but tests run on Unix).
  Lists sort case-insensitively by name. Malformed or missing config always
  degrades to an empty list, never an error.
- **`process.rs`** exists because the registry's `open` flag survives a full
  Obsidian quit (that's how Obsidian restores vaults on relaunch).
  `list_vaults` clears all open flags when no Obsidian process is running;
  the name match requires the exact executable or a real delimiter
  (`obsidian`, `Obsidian.exe`, `Obsidian Helper …`) so tools like
  `obsidian-sync` don't count.
- **`daily_notes.rs`** reads each vault's `.obsidian/daily-notes.json`
  (folder + moment-style format). Only the `YYYY`/`MM`/`DD` tokens are
  supported, matched as whole letter runs — `MMMM` or `YYYYMMDD` fall back
  to the default format entirely rather than half-substituting, because a
  wrong literal path would make Obsidian silently create a misnamed note.
  The rendered path is vault-relative **without** `.md` (the URI `file`
  parameter's expected form).
- **`uri.rs`** addresses vaults by **ID, never name** (folder names can
  collide across vaults) and percent-encodes every parameter.
  `daily_note_uri` (in `core/src/lib.rs`) picks `obsidian://open` when the
  note file exists and `obsidian://new` otherwise — creation happens inside
  Obsidian.
- **`vaults` store** re-runs discovery on every panel open (one JSON read;
  a user who just launched Obsidian must not stay stuck on a cached empty
  list) but keeps the previous list when a refresh fails transiently, so a
  working panel never blanks. Launching a vault closes the panel; a failed
  launch keeps it open with the error banner.
- **`VaultList.vue`** surfaces `open: true` vaults first under an "Open
  now" header (flat list when nothing is open); the name/path filter only
  appears above 5 vaults.

### The capture domain (`src-tauri/capture/` + `capture_commands.rs` + `capture` store)

One-click meeting/voice recording into the vault (Knowledge Intake,
increment 2). `vault_buddy_capture` owns the audio engine: cpal devices
(WASAPI loopback on Windows in meeting mode) → mixer → streaming LAME MP3
into a hidden dot-prefixed `.mp3.part` in the target folder (flush ~1 s,
fsync ~30 s) → finalize. Invariants — every one exists because a reviewer
found the failure it prevents:

- **Never lose captured audio; never clobber user files.** Base names are
  reserved pairwise (`.mp3` + `.md` + `.mp3.part` all free), files are
  exclusive-created, finalization uses `rename_noreplace` (hard-link based;
  `std::fs::rename` replaces on every platform) with suffix-retry, and
  companion notes are written atomically via owned `.vault-buddy.tmp` temps.
- **Recovery touches only our own files**: dated `YYYY/MM` layout only,
  capture-pattern basenames only (`is_capture_base` lives beside
  `base_name` with round-trip tests), marker-suffixed note temps only;
  staleness-gated, postponed while a recording is active, retried while
  work is pending.
- **The buddy is the recording indicator**: all hide paths funnel through
  `tray::hide_buddy` (the single guarded chokepoint); quit/close finalize
  on worker threads — never block the event loop — and the app exits only
  after the save lands.
- **Pause is a session Control message** (`Control { Stop, Pause, Resume }`
  on the one channel the shell's device thread forwards): streams stay
  open, drained samples are discarded, nothing is encoded, the fsync
  cadence keeps running — and pause can never block shutdown
  (stop-while-paused finalizes normally). Level metering (`capture:level`,
  ~5 Hz, 0–1) is advisory and lossy by design.
- **Rename never breaks the capture contract**: `rename_plan` (core)
  keeps the `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm ` prefix and refuses non-capture files;
  execution reuses the reservation + `rename_noreplace` + suffix-retry
  loop, retargets exactly the note's embed line, and a note-side failure
  after a successful audio move degrades to a warning (audio first).
  Config writes stay app-side: owned temp + REPLACING rename is correct
  for `config.json` only, serialized behind `ConfigWriteLock`.
- Per-vault settings live app-side in `%APPDATA%\vault-buddy\config.json`
  (documented in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`); parsing is per-field defensive so
  one malformed value can never flip a vault's mode.

### Diagnostics invariants

- Every spawned thread is named (`std::thread::Builder`) — crash records
  must identify the dying thread.
- No swallowed error: anything caught-and-hidden goes through
  `log::warn!`/`log::error!` (Rust) or `src/logging.ts` (frontend);
  user-facing failures funnel through their domain chokepoint (e.g.
  `emit_failed`).
- Exit paths: the run loop stamps the clean-shutdown marker
  automatically; any code that terminates via `std::process::exit` must
  call `diagnostics::mark_clean_shutdown()` first or the next launch
  reports a crash.
- The panic hook + native crash handler are installed before the
  builder — nothing may be moved ahead of them.

### Frontend state

Each window loads the same bundle and mounts a different root by its label:
`main.ts` reads `getCurrentWindow().label` and `rootFor(label)`
(`src/roots/index.ts`, a pure map, unit-tested) picks the component —
`main` → `BuddyRoot`, `panel` → `PanelRoot`, `bubble` → `BubbleRoot`, any
unexpected label → `BuddyRoot`. The roots are thin: `BuddyRoot` hosts
`CompanionCharacter` and invokes `toggle_panel`/`close_panel`; `PanelRoot`
hosts `ActionPanel` and closes via `close_panel` on Escape/gutter-click;
`BubbleRoot` hosts the greeting and calls `close_bubble` on dismiss.

Panel visibility is no longer a store flag — it IS the panel window's
show/hide state, owned by Rust. So the `vaults` store lost `panelOpen`/
`togglePanel` and gained `refresh()` (re-run discovery on panel mount). It
still holds the list and the panel view state (`view: list | settings |
captureSettings` with `captureSettingsVaultId`) because that must survive the
panel window being hidden.

Other Pinia stores: `updates` (phase machine:
idle/checking/upToDate/available/installing/error), `settings` (buddy
character/animation, persisted to localStorage), and `capture` (recording
state mirrored from Rust: `paused`, `pausedTotalMs`, `level`, `vaultId`,
`lastSaved`).

Cross-window state travels two ways: Tauri events broadcast to every window
(Rust-driven animation/dragging toggles from the menu handlers; capture
level/state), and localStorage `storage` events — a settings change in the
panel window fires `settings.syncFromStorage()` in the buddy window so the
buddy re-reads character/animation without an IPC round-trip.

## Testing conventions

- Tests live in `tests/*.test.ts` (Vitest + happy-dom + @vue/test-utils).
  Tauri IPC is mocked with `mockIPC` from `@tauri-apps/api/mocks`; plugin
  modules are mocked with `vi.mock` + `vi.hoisted`. Tests must never require
  a real Tauri runtime.
- Rust unit tests sit next to the code in `src-tauri/core/` and
  `src-tauri/capture/`; keep new logic in the core crate whenever it doesn't
  need Tauri types, precisely so it's testable everywhere. (`capture` needs
  `libasound2-dev` on Linux for cpal — CI installs it.)
- This repo practices TDD via the vendored superpowers skills
  (`.claude/skills/`, injected by a SessionStart hook): failing test first,
  then the fix. Regression tests name the failure mode in a comment.

## Conventions

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits with scopes seen in history:
  `feat(ui)`, `fix(updates)`, `fix(shell)`, `fix(vaults)`, `style(core)`,
  `ci(release)`, `chore(release)`. Imperative subject, body explains the
  *why* and the failure mode being fixed.
- **Comments:** explain constraints the code can't show (race windows,
  platform quirks, why an ordering matters) — not what the next line does.
  Match the existing density; this codebase comments invariants heavily.
- **PRs:** every PR gets an automated Codex review (chatgpt-codex-connector
  bot) plus GitGuardian secret scanning. CI = frontend job + rust-core job,
  then the Windows build. Treat bot findings as real leads: verify against
  the code, fix what's confirmed, resolve the thread.

## Releases

Release = version bump in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (+ both lockfiles) on `main`, then either push a
`v*` tag **or** dispatch the Release workflow with the tag as input
(`gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z` / the Actions UI). The
dispatch path exists because remote agent sessions can push branches but
not tags (the git proxy 403s tag refs); `tauri-action` creates the tag and
the GitHub release itself either way. The workflow signs updater artifacts
(`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets) and attaches `latest.json`, which
installed apps poll from Settings → Updates. CI builds without updater
artifacts when the signing secrets are absent (forked PRs) instead of
failing.
